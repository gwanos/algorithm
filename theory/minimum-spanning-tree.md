# MinimumSpanningTree

## Definition

## Applications

- Network design: telephone, electrial, TV cable, road, etc. i.e. Getting a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost.
- Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.
- Indirect applications: reducing data storage in sequencing amino acids in a protein, autoconfig protocol for Ethernet bridging to avoid cycles in a network.
- Cluster analysis: k clustering problem can be viewed as finding an MST and deleting the k-1 most expensive edges.

### Disjoint Set(or Union-Find)

A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
